# GDCpy

## Introduction

This project is a work-in-progress library for python meant to act as a **custom analysis-oriented suite** for *downloading, pre-processing and working with* data from the National Cancer Institute's (NCI) **Genetic Data Commons (GDC)** respository of genomic and clinical data, accessible through their API, encompassing a total of 22 genome programs including the **TCGA, OCG, and TARGET**.
> Analysis-oriented here means, based on all the data-types available, the types of values present, such as; 
> * genetic, isoform, and miRNA expression quantification measures,
> * copy numbers and copy number segments,
> * somatic mutation measures,
> * DNA methylation arrays,
> * among others,
> 
> There'll be options for relevant plots and maps as well as statistical measures such as SDs (Ïƒ), MADs, coefficients of variations, available to be run and calculated, with flexibility in comparison.

The documentation for this API is available at https://docs.gdc.cancer.gov/API/PDF/API_UG.pdf

> (This project will be uploaded and worked on as freely accessible .ipynb notebooks, providing a guide to downloading and pre-processing data,
> until the final compilation and packaging as an importable python library)
